an RPN calculator for the shell

## Preface and history 📜

First of all: This calculator is not another exactly emulated Hewlett Packard ™ calculator nor is it using ROM files to provide the full functionality. At the current state, it is not able to store and execute [RPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPL_(programming_language))-programs. Even so, if you are used to those calculators, you might remember and recognize the most useful [commands](https://literature.hpcalc.org/community/hp48sx-qrg-en.pdf).
Lets say, the calculator mimics its great predecessors. In addition to the usual abbreviated commands, these can also be written as full words. Note that some commands are not implemented in the famous calculators but I found them to be useful anyway.

I am using RPN calculators since I was a teenager and still appreciate it. Hence, it is my intention to program a calculator which supports RPN (reverse polish notation) on the one hand and is executable in a terminal on the other hand. It is written in pure python and designed to be a simple and distraction free terminal shell tool with no dependencies. Despite the simple design, it has become a quite powerful calculator with a lot of functions.
(Actually, this calculator has come a long way: I originally planned to create a pure Bash implementation using `bc` in the background, but ultimately decided against it during the implementation process. The current Python implementation is much more powerful and easier to maintain than the original Bash version would have been.)

Again, keep in mind: This is not the real and famous HP42S™ or HP48SX™ that is supporting programming, unit conversions, graphs, equation solvers, libraries and lots of things I do not even know of. Those real calculators are an industrial and technical work of art I admire and may never be compared with.

## Installation 📦

### Linux installation 🐧

* Run `sudo apt install python3` for Debian. Installation for other distributions may vary. There is no other dependencies.
* run `./rpn.py` to start the calculator 🚀

### Windows installation 🪟️

* install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (Tested with Windows 11 only)
* use `run.bat` to start the calculator or open a cmd-shell and execute `py ./rpn.py` 🚀

## Usage 💡

### Disclaimer ⚠️

Don't use this calculator if you plan to fly to the moon. I'm not kidding — expect that some results might be wrong. Testing all functions and edge cases is a huge task.

### General 👆

* If you are not familiar with rpn calculators and with [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), you might not want to learn this notation unless you know the advantage of this concept and are willing to rethink.
* Typing in either small or capital letters is valid.
* Errors are shown in red and cleared after 2 seconds.
* Decimal numbers are separated by a period.
* the size of the stack is unlimited (in theory).

### Hotkeys ⌨️

* CTRL-X → exit
* CTRL-L → clears
* BACKSPACE →drop stack 1
* DEL → drop stack 1
* CTRL-K → drop actual input >
* TAB → swap stack 1 and stack 2
* ENTER → duplicate stack 1 (if input is empty)
* CTRL-E → edit stack 1
* CTRL-N → help

**Hint (ℹ):** If a hotkey is not working, this is most likely due to the terminal shell in use and it's predefined hotkeys. Workaround: enter the according command at the input prompt and hit *ENTER*.

### Commands ⚡

#### Info about commands 📝️

commands are executed by typing in and hit *ENTER*. This might feel rather like a shell therefore.

* Advantages:
  * no polling for keys but just waiting for input.
    * No CPU usage at this point.
    * Simple Code.
    * shell feeling
    * commands should be mostly the sames as the commands of RPN calculators
    * easy to memorize
  * Disadvantages:
    * typing commands for a calculator might feel unusual at first

#### General commands 📢️

* `exit`or `quit` or just `off` followed by hitting the *ENTER*-key to leave the rpn calculator.
* `help` or `hlp` to get a quite detailed help.
* `about` or `info` to get a little bit info about myself, the calculator and the license
* `refresh` to clear a destroyed UI.
* hitting the *ENTER*-key, the stack 1 value in the stack gets duplicated.
* hitting the *ENTER*-key after a command is performing it.

#### Stack commands

* `clr` or `clear` will clear the entire stack.
* `swap` will swap stack 1 and 2.
* `drop` will delete stack 1.
* `drop2` will delete stack 1 and stack 2.
* `dup` or `duplicate` or `enter` will duplicate stack 1

* `edit` to edit stack 1
* `depth` → number of elements in stack.
* `avg` or `average` → average of entire stack.
* `sum` → sum of entire stack.
* `rollup` → Moves the very last element of the stack to Level 1 (Bottom to Top).

* `over` → copies stack 2 to stack 1 (without deleting stack 1).
* `pick` → copy stack[n] to top (n from stack 1, 1-based)

#### Basic Arithmetic Operations ∑

As with the real rpn calculators, hitting the operators does execute an *immediate* operation. You do NOT have to hit the *ENTER*-key to do so.

#### Constants ◆

The following constants are implemented for now and can be entered followed by hitting *ENTER*:

* `pi` : 3.1415927… (π)
* `tau`: 6.2831853… (𝜏 = 2π)
* `c` or `lightspeed`: 299792458 m/s (𝑐)
* `euler` : 2.7182818… (ℯ)
* `gravity` or `g`: 9.80665m/s² (𝑔)
* `phy`or `goldenratio`: 1.6180339887… (φ = (1 + √5) / 2)

#### Memory commands

* `mem` or `memory` → shows all available memory of the OS, if supported.
* `sto` or `store` will store value of stack 1 into memory and delete the value in the stack.
* `rcl` or `recall` will recall value from memory and append it to the stack. Memory contains `0` by default.
* `mc` or `memclr` or `mclear` will clear the memory and set it to `0`.

### Modes

#### Display Modes ⚙️

* `fix` → Fixed-Decimal (default), will set and show `n` display digits by the stack 1 value.
    E.g. `3 *ENTER* fix *ENTER*` will limit to 3 digits. Allowed value is `0-16`
* `eng` → Engineering notation, will set and show `n` display digits by the stack 1 value
* `sci` → Scientific notation, will set and show `n` display digits by the stack 1 value

#### Base Modes ⚙️

* `dec` will show the stack in *decimal* values
* `hex` will show the stack in *hexadecimal* values
* `bin` will show the stack in *binary* values
* `oct` will show the stack in *octal* values
* the current mode is indicated below the stack at the input prompt if not in *decimal-mode*

#### Notation of dec, hex or bin value(s) ✒️

The notation of a hexadecimal or binary number can be typed in as follows:

* decimal notation of exponential numbers: (e.g. 3e6, 1.5E4, 5.2e-3, …)
* binary: e.g.: `0b1111`, `0b10101010`, …
* hexadecimal : e.g. like `0xabcd`, `0xAFAEBD`, … or directly without leading 0b or 0x.

Further notice:

* **Mixing decimal, hexadecimal and binary values in the stack is not possible.**
* if in decimal mode, all entered values with leading `0x`, `0b` or `0o` are directly converted into the decimal value.
* same behavior and conversion for the other modes

#### Conversion Modes

* deg2rad or d>r or deg>rad → Degrees-to-radians conversion.
* rad2deg or r>d or rad>deg → radians → degrees
* \>hms or 2hms              → decimal hours → H.MMSSss
* \>h   or 2hours            → H.MMSSss → decimal hours

### Limitations ▲ ▼

* the digits are limited to the value **`16`**.

I'm developing this pocket calculator in my spare time, so you'll notice that many features and functions — such as the following — are missing:

* programming
* matrix
* plotting
* variables
* Equation solving
* arrays
* complex number handling
* Unit conversion
* IO and many other fancy features
* small subset of hotkeys — Esc-Key and F-Keys are non-functional

For the moment, I do not have intentions to implement these features. There might be other apropriate tools to use.

### To Do's 🚧

The following features are on my to do list:

* rad, deg, (grad: not useful)
* thousands-separator: ‘,‘ or ‘'‘
* missing commands
  * beep
  * bytes
  * date and time functions (date, date+, ddays)
  * dropn
  * dupn, pickn
  * key (would be nice for debugging new hotkeys)
  * lnp1 Natural logarithm of (x + 1).
  * max, min, maxr, minr
  * sto+-/*
